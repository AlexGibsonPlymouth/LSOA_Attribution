<p style = "font-size:110%; color:#000000; text-align: justify;">This tool uses open source data to attribute LSOA11-based data to LSOA21 geographies. Full source and methodology details, along with important caveats regarding the use of this tool, are available <a href="FullInformation.html" target="_blank">here</a> (opens new tab). The tool has been extensively tested, but .... <span style = color:#ff0000>use with care and 'sense-check' the results!</span></p>

<p style = "font-size:110%; color:#000000; text-align: justify;">The interface should be self-explanatory. Once the file with data using 2011 LSOAs has been selected it will appear in the main panel. <span style = color:#ff0000>(This file MUST contain all 32,844 2011 LSOAs - 1 per row - and the 1st column MUST contain LSOA codes and be titled 'LSOA11CD'.)</span> Then simply follow the instructions. Do, however, remember that although the vast majority (94.1%) of 2021 LSOAs are unchanged since 2011, those remaining are based on merged, split or, very rarely, more complex combinations of 2011 LSOAs <u>because</u> there have been significant population changes - e.g. large-scale housing developments.</p>

<p style = "font-size:110%; color:#000000; text-align: justify;">Thus, although recent data published using the old 2011 Statistical Geography (e.g. via Stat-Explore) can be attributed to 2021 LSOAs with some confidence, older data (e.g. 2019 IMD scores which are actually based on 2016 data) are likely to be of limited value where changes have occured <span style = color:#ff0000>because of the probable changes to the socio-economic composition of local populations!</span>  For that reason each 2021 output file includes a column stating whether the 2021 LSOA is unchanged since 2011 ('U') or is based on split ('S'), merged ('M') or more complex combinations of 2011 LSOAs ('X').</p>
